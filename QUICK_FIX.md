# 🚨 QUICK FIX: "relation 'routes' does not exist"

## The Problem
Your application is trying to access database tables that haven't been created yet in Supabase.

## ✅ Solution - 3 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Get your **Project URL** and **anon key** from Settings → API

### Step 2: Create Environment File
Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url-here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### Step 3: Run Database Schema
1. Go to **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy the entire SQL from `DATABASE_SETUP.md`
3. Run the SQL to create all tables

## 🎯 What This Fixes

- ✅ Creates all required database tables
- ✅ Sets up proper permissions (RLS policies)
- ✅ Enables user authentication
- ✅ Allows the application to function normally

## 🚀 After Setup

Once you complete these steps:
1. **Restart your development server** (`npm run dev`)
2. **The application will work normally** - no more errors!
3. **You can create user accounts** and test all features

## 📋 Tables Created

The schema creates these essential tables:
- `profiles` - User accounts and roles
- `routes` - Collection routes
- `attendance` - Staff check-in/out
- `tasks` - Work assignments
- `collection_logs` - Waste collection data
- `compost_operations` - Facility operations
- `citizen_reports` - Community reports
- `notifications` - System alerts
- `sustainability_metrics` - Environmental data

## 🔧 Current Status

- ✅ **Application code** - Ready and working
- ✅ **Database schema** - Available in `DATABASE_SETUP.md`
- ⚠️ **Database setup** - Needs to be completed in Supabase
- ⚠️ **Environment variables** - Need to be added

## 🎉 Once Complete

You'll have a fully functional waste management system with:
- Real user authentication
- Role-based access control
- Mobile interface for field workers
- Admin dashboard for management
- Citizen reporting portal
- Real-time data tracking
