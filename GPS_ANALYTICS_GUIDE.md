  const clusters = []
  const visited = new Set()
  const clusterRadius = 0.001 // ~100m in degrees
  
  points.forEach((point, index) => {
    if (visited.has(index)) return
    
    const cluster = {
      center: { lat: point.lat, lng: point.lng },
      points: [point],
      count: 1,
      radius: clusterRadius
    }
    
    // Find nearby points within 100m
    points.forEach((otherPoint, otherIndex) => {
      if (visited.has(otherIndex) || index === otherIndex) return
      
      const distance = calculateDistance(
        point.lat, point.lng,
        otherPoint.lat, otherPoint.lng
      )
      
      if (distance <= 100) {
        cluster.points.push(otherPoint)
        cluster.count++
        visited.add(otherIndex)
      }
    })
    
    if (cluster.count > 1) {
      clusters.push(cluster)
    }
    
    visited.add(index)
  })
  
  return clusters.sort((a, b) => b.count - a.count)
}
```

### 2. Coverage Analysis
```javascript
// Coverage area calculation
const calculateArea = (bounds) => {
  const latDiff = bounds.north - bounds.south
  const lngDiff = bounds.east - bounds.west
  
  // Convert to square meters
  return latDiff * lngDiff * 111000 * 111000
}

// Coverage radius calculation
const calculateCoverageRadius = (points) => {
  const bounds = calculateBounds(points)
  const centerLat = (bounds.north + bounds.south) / 2
  const centerLng = (bounds.east + bounds.west) / 2
  
  let maxDistance = 0
  points.forEach(point => {
    const distance = calculateDistance(
      centerLat, centerLng,
      point.lat, point.lng
    )
    maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, distance)
  })
  
  return maxDistance
}
```

### 3. Density Scoring
```javascript
// Density score calculation
const calculateDensityScore = (points, bounds) => {
