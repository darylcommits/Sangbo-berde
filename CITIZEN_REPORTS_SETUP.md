# 🚨 Citizen Reports System Setup Guide

## 📋 Overview
This guide will help you set up the citizen reporting system to ensure reports are properly stored and visible to both citizens and admin staff.

## 🎯 Current Status
Based on your SQL file, you already have:
- ✅ `citizen_reports` table exists
- ✅ Sample data with 2 reports
- ✅ Proper table structure with all required fields

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### 1. **Import Existing Data**
Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Check existing data
SELECT COUNT(*) as existing_reports FROM citizen_reports;

-- If you need to import the sample data
-- (Run the contents of import_citizen_reports.sql)
```

### 2. **Verify Database Connection**
The system will automatically:
- ✅ Try to fetch from database first
- ✅ Fall back to local storage if database fails
- ✅ Show demo data if no data exists

### 3. **Test the System**

#### **As a Citizen:**
1. Login to Citizen Portal
2. Go to "Report" tab
3. Submit a new report
4. Check "My Reports" to see your submissions

#### **As an Admin:**
1. Login to Admin Dashboard
2. Go to "Reports" section
3. View all citizen reports
4. See report statistics and management options
